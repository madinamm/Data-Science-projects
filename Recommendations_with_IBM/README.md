# IBM Article Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a recommendation system for articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. By analyzing user interactions with articles, the system provides personalized recommendations to enhance user experience. The project involves various techniques, including exploratory data analysis, rank-based recommendations, user-user collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze user interactions to understand the dataset and identify key metrics.
- **Rank-Based Recommendations**: Generate a list of the most popular articles based on user interactions.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implement user-user collaborative filtering to recommend articles based on similar user interactions.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user interactions with articles.
