# Struggling to Price Your Airbnb Listing in Amsterdam? Here’s What the Data Says

## Introduction: Why Is Pricing So Hard?

Ever found yourself second-guessing the price of your Airbnb listing? Too high, and the calendar stays empty. Too low, and you’re leaving money on the table. Pricing an Airbnb can feel like a guessing game – but it doesn’t have to be.

In this project, we dug into Airbnb data from Amsterdam to uncover what really drives pricing. By analyzing factors like bedrooms, reviews, and property types, we built a model that can help hosts set smarter, data-backed prices.

Whether you’re new to hosting or just looking to optimize your listing, here’s what the data reveals – and how it can help you avoid common pricing pitfalls.

## What We Wanted to Know

We focused on three big questions:

1. What makes some Airbnb listings more expensive than others?
Does the number of bedrooms, property type, or neighborhood have the biggest impact?


2. Can we build a model that predicts listing prices based on key features?


3. How accurate are the price predictions compared to real listings?

## The Process: Data and Approach

We analyzed a dataset from Airbnb Amsterdam (September 2024), packed with details about listings – from the number of bedrooms to guest ratings.

For simplicity, we focused on the most impactful factors: Number of bedrooms, Guest capacity (accommodates), Room type (Private room, Shared room, Entire home), Review scores, total reviews and more.

Using linear regression, we built a pricing model to predict how much a listing should cost.

## The Eye-Opening Results

Here’s what stood out:
1. More Space = More Money

Listings with more bedrooms and higher guest capacity had the strongest positive correlation with price. If you can host more people, you can charge more.


2. Entire Homes Command Higher Prices

Private rooms had the lowest average prices, while entire homes or apartments topped the charts. If you’re renting out an entire place, higher rates are justified.


3. Reviews Can Be Misleading

Listings with lots of reviews were often cheaper. One guess? These properties might be rented more frequently and priced competitively.

However, high review scores (not just the number of reviews) were linked to higher prices. If guests love your place, you can likely charge a premium.

## How Good Are the Predictions?

So, can the model actually predict prices? The answer is yes – but with some caveats.

The model works best for mid-range listings but struggles with luxury properties or outliers. Excluding extreme listings improves the accuracy significantly.

R-squared score: 0.34 – This means the model explains about 34% of price variation, which is solid for predicting general trends.

The scatter plot below shows predicted vs. actual prices. Notice the clear upward trend – proof that the model captures price patterns, even if it misses some high-end outliers.

## Why This Matters for Hosts

Tired of guessing? This model offers data-driven price recommendations.

Worried about pricing mistakes? It can flag listings priced way above (or below) market value.

Struggling with empty dates? Competitive pricing, based on real data, could improve bookings.

## Where We Can Improve

Luxury listings throw off predictions. Expanding the model to include more qualitative factors could help.

Beyond Amsterdam – Applying this to listings in other cities could reveal broader insights.

Better use of reviews – Analyzing review content, not just scores, might offer even stronger pricing signals.

## Final Thoughts

Pricing an Airbnb doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. By analyzing real data, we’ve created a roadmap for smarter, more profitable pricing. Whether you’re setting your first price or updating an existing listing, these insights can help you find the sweet spot.
